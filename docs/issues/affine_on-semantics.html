<h3><code>affine_on</code> semantics</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 33.13.3 <a href="https://wg21.link/exec.affine.on">[exec.affine.on]</a></p>
<p><b>Submitter:</b> Dietmar K&uuml;hl</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The specification of <code>affine_on</code> uses "current execution
resource" and it is unclear what that means exactly. Additionally,
it is unclear what the difference between <code>affine_on</code>
and <code>continues_on</code> is. The main intention of
<code>affine_on</code> is to avoid unnecessary scheduling which
<code>continues_on</code> is already allowed to do in some cases,
too.
</p>
<p>
The intended semantics is that <code>affine_on</code> will either
complete inline on what execution it was started on or it will
complete asynchronously on the specified execution context. With
this formulation <code>affine_on</code> may complete on one of two
different execution context if it is started on an execution context
that is different from the one specified by the scheduler.
