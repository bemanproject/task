# General

After LWG voted to forward the [task
proposal](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html)
to be forwarded to plenary for inclusion into C++26 some issues
were brought up. The concerns range from accidental omissions (e.g.,
`unhandled_stopped` lacking `noexcept`) via wording issues and
performance concerns to some design questions. In particular the
behaviour of the algorithm `affine_on` used to implement scheduler
affinity for `task` received some questions which may lead to some
design changes and/or clarifications. This document discusses the
various issues raised and proposes ways to address some of them.

One statement from the plenary was that `task` is the obvious name
for a coroutine task and we should get it right. There are certainly
improvements which can be applied. Although I'm not aware of anything
concrete beyond the raised issues there is probably potential for
improvements. If the primary concern is that there may be better
task interfaces in the future and a better task should get the name
`task`, it seems reasonable to rename the component. The original
name used for the component was `lazy` and feedback from Hagenberg
was to rename it `task`. In principle, any name could work, e.g.,
`affine_task`. It seems reasonable to keep `task` in the name somehow
if `task` is to be renamed.

Specifically for `task` it is worth pointing out that multiple
coroutine task components can coexist. Due to the design of coroutines
and sender/receiver different coroutine tasks can interoperate.

# The Concerns

Some concerns were posted to the LWG chat on Mattermost (they were
originally raised on a Discord chat where multiple of the authors
of sender/receiver components coordinate the work). Other concerns
were raised separately (and the phrasing isn't exactly that of the
originally, e.g., because it was stated in a different language). I
became aware of all but one of these concerns after the poll by LWG
to forward the proposal for inclusion into C++26.  The rest of this
section discusses these concerns:

## `affine_on` Concerns

This section covers different concerns around the specification,
or rather lack thereof, of `affine_on`. The algorithm `affine_on`
is at the core of the scheduler affinity implementation: this
algorithm is used to establish the invariant that a `task` executes
on the currently installed scheduler. Originally, the `task` proposal
used `continue_on` in the specification but during the SG1 discussion
it was suggested that a differently named algorithm is used. The
original idea was that `affine_on(@_sndr_@, @_sch_@)` behaves like
`continues_on(@_sndr_@, @_sch_@)` but it is customised to avoid
actual scheduling when it knows that `@_sndr_@` completes on
`@_sch_@`. When further exploring the direction of using a different
algorithm than `continues_on` some additional potential for changed
semantics emerged (see below).

The name `affine_on` was _not_ discussed by SG1. The
direction was "come up with a name". The current name just concentrates
on the primary objective of implementing scheduler affinity for
`task`. It can certainly use a different name. For example the
algorithm could be called `continues_inline_or_on` or
`affine_continues_on`.

To some extend `affine_on`'s specification is deliberately vague
because currently the `execution` specification is lacking some
tools which would allow omission of scheduling, e.g., for `just`
which completes immediately with a result. While users can't
necessarily tap into the customisations, yet, implementation could
use tools like those proposed by [P3206](https://wg21.link/p3206)
"A sender query for completion behaviour" using a suitable hidden
name while the proposal isn't adopted.

### `affine_on` Default Implementation Lacks a Specification

The wording of
[`affine_on`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#executionaffine_on-exec.affine.on)
doesn't have a specification for the default implementation. For
other algorithms the default implementation is specified. To resolve
this concern add a new paragraph in
[`affine_on`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#executionaffine_on-exec.affine.on)
to provide a specification for the default implementation:

::: add
> [5]{.pnum} Let `sndr` and `env` be subexpressions such that `Sndr`
> is `decltype((sndr))`. If `@_sender-for_@<Sndr, affine_on_t>` is
> `false`, then the expression `affine_on.transform_sender(sndr, env)` is
> ill-formed; otherwise, it is equivalent to:
>
> ```
> auto [_, sch, child] = sndr;
> return transform_sender(
>   @_query-with-default_@(get_domain, sch, default_domain()),
>   continues_on(std::move(child), std::move(sch)));
> ```
>
> except that `sch` is only evaluated once.
:::

The intention for `affine_on` was to all optimisation/customisation
in a way reducing the necessary scheduling: if the implementation
can determine if a sender completed already on the correct execution
agent it should be allowed to avoid scheduling. That may be achieved
by using `get_completion_scheduler<set_value_t>` of the sender,
using (for now implementation specific) queries like those proposed
by
[P3206 "A sender query for completion behaviour"](https://wg21.link/P3206),
or some other means. Unfortunately, the specification proposed above
seems to disallow implementation specific techniques to avoid
scheduling. Future revisions of the standard could require some of
the techniques to avoid scheduling assuming the necessary infrastructure
gets standardised.

### `affine_on` Semantics Are Not Clear

The wording in
[`affine_on`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#executionaffine_on-exec.affine.on)
p5 says:

> ...  Calling `start(op)` will start `sndr` on the current execution
> agent and execution completion operations on `out_rcvr` on an
> execution agent of the execution resource associated with `sch`.
> If the current execution resource is the same as the execution
> resource associated with `sch`, the completion operation on
> `out_rcvr` may be invoked on the same thread of execution before
> `start(op)` completes. If scheduling onto `sch` fails, an error
> completion on `out_rcvr` shall be executed on an unspecified
> execution agent.

The sentence If the current execution resource is the same as the
execution resource associated with `sch` is not clear to which
execution resource is the "current execution resource". It could
be the "current execution agent" that was used to call `start(op)`,
or it could be the execution agent that the predecessor completes
on.

The intended meaning for "current execution resource" was to refer
to the execution resource of the execution agent that was used to
call `stop(op)`. The specification could be clarified by changing
the wording to become:

> ...  Calling `start(op)` will start `sndr` on the current execution
> agent and execution completion operations on `out_rcvr` on an
> execution agent of the execution resource associated with `sch`.
> If the [current]{.rm} execution resource [of the execution agent
> that was used to invoke `start(op)` ]{.add} is the same as the
> execution resource associated with `sch`, the completion operation
> on `out_rcvr` may be called before `start(op)` completes. If
> scheduling onto `sch` fails, an error completion on `out_rcvr`
> shall be executed on an unspecified execution agent.

It is also not clear what the actual difference in semantics
between `continues_on` and `affine_on` is. The `continues_on`
semantics already requires that the resulting sender completes on
the specified schedulers execution agent. It does not specify that
it must evaluate a `schedule()` (although that is what the default
Implementation does), and so in theory it already permits an
implementation/customisation to skip the schedule (e.g. if the child
senders completion scheduler was equal to the target scheduler).

The key semantic that we want here is to specify one of two possible
semantics that differ from `continues_on`:

1. That the completion of an `affine_on` sender will occur on the
    same scheduler that the operation started on. This is a slightly
    stronger requirement than that of `continues_on`, in that it
    puts a requirement on the caller of `affine_on` to ensure that
    the operation is started on the scheduler passed to `affine_on`,
    but then also grants permission for the operation to complete
    inline if it completes synchronously.
2. That the completion of an `affine_on` sender will either complete
    inline on the execution agent that it was started on, or it
    will complete asynchronously on an execution agent associated
    with the provided scheduler. This is a slightly more permissive
    than option 1. in that it permits the caller to start on any
    context, but also is no longer able to definitively advertise
    a completion context, since it might now complete on one of two
    possible contexts (even if in many cases those two contexts
    might be the same). This weaker semantic can be used in conjunction
    with knowledge by the caller that they will start the operation
    on a context associated with the same scheduler passed to
    `affine_on` to ensure that the operation will complete on the
    given scheduler.

The description in the paper at the Hagenberg meeting assumed that
`task` uses `continues_on` directly to achieve scheduler affinity.
During the SG1 discussion it was requested that the approach to
scheduler affinity doesn't use `continues_on` directly but rather
uses a different algorithm which can be customised separately. This
is the algorithm now named `affine_on`. The intention was that
`affine_on` can avoid scheduling in more cases than `continues_on`.

It is worth noting that an implementation can't determine the
execution resource of the execution agent which invoked `start(op)`
directly. If `rcvr` is the receiver used to create `op` it can be
queried for `get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))` which is intended to
yield this execution resource. However, there is no guarantee that
this is the case [yet?].

The intended direction here is to pursue the second possibility
mentioned above. Compared to `continues_on` that would effectively
relax the requirement that `affine_on` completes on `sch` if `sender`
doesn't actually change schedulers and completes inline: if `start(op)`
gets invoked on an execution agents which matches `sch`'s execution
resources the guarantee holds but `affine_on` would be allowed to
complete on the execution agent `start(op)` was invoked. It is upon
the user to invoke `start(op)` on the correct execution agent.

Another difference to `continues_on` is that `affine_on` can be
separately customised.

### `affine_on`'s Shape May Not Be Correct

The `affine_on` algorithm defined in
[`affine_on`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#executionaffine_on-exec.affine.on) takes two arguments; a
[`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts) and a
[`scheduler`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.sched).

As mentioned above, the semantic that we really want for the purpose
in coroutines is that the operation completes on the same execution
context that it started on. This way, we can ensure, by induction,
that the coroutine which starts on the right context, and resumes
on the same context after each suspend-point, will itself complete
on the same context.

This then also begs the question: Could we just take the scheduler
that the operation will be started on from the
[`get_scheduler`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.get.scheduler) query
on the receivers environment and avoid having to explicitly pass
the scheduler as an argument?

To this end, we should consider potentially simplifying the `affine_on`
algorithm to just take an input sender and to pick up the scheduler
that it will be started on from the receivers environment and promise
to complete on that context.

For example, the
[`await_transform`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html?validation_key=7c6057b778f7a41d2ba63fd94676bf5e#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
function could potentially be changed to return:
`as_awaitable(affine_on(std::forward<Sndr>(sndr)))`.  Then we could
define the `affine_on.transform_sender(sndr, env)` expression (which
provides the default implementation) to be equivalent to
`continues_on(sndr, get_scheduler(env))`.

Such an approach would also a require change to the semantic
requirements of `get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))` to require that
`start(op)` is called on that context.

This change isn't strictly necessary, though. The interface of
`affine_on` as is can be used. Making this change does improve the
design. Nothing outside of `task` is currently using `affine_on`
and as it is an algorithm tailored for `task`'s needs it seems
reasonable to make it fit this use case exactly. This change would
also align with the direction that the execution agent used to
invoke `start(op)` matches the execution resource of
`get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))`.

### `affine_on` Shouldn't Forward Stop Requests To Scheduling Operations

The `affine_on` algorithm is used by the `task` coroutine to ensure
that the coroutine always resumes back on its associated scheduler
by applying the `affine_on` algorithm to each awaited value in a
`co_await` expression.

In cases where the awaited operation completes asynchronously,
resumption of the coroutine will be scheduled using the coroutines
associated scheduler via a
[`schedule`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.schedule) operation.

If that schedule operation completes with `set_value` then the
coroutine successfully resumes on its associated execution context.
However, if it completes with `set_error` or `set_stopped` then resuming
the coroutine on the execution context of the completion is not
going to preserve the invariant that the coroutine is always going
to resume on its associated context.

For some cases this may not be an issue, but for other cases,
resuming on the right execution context may be important for
correctness, even during exception unwind or due to cancellation.
For example, destructors may require running in a UI thread in order
to release UI resources. Or the associated scheduler may be a strand
(which runs all tasks scheduled to it sequentially) in order to
synchronise access to shared resources used by destructors.

Thus, if a stop-request has been sent to the coroutine, that
stop-request should be propagated to child operations so that the
child operation it is waiting on can be cancelled if necessary, but
should probably not be propagated to any schedule operation created
by the implicit `affine_on` algorithm as this is needed to complete
successfully in order to ensure the coroutine resumes on its
associated context.

One option to work around this with the status-quo would be to
define a scheduler adapter that adapted the underlying `schedule()`
operation to prevent passing through stop-requests from the parent
environment (e.g. applying the [`unstoppable`](https://wg21.link/p3284)
adapter). If failing to reschedule onto the associated context was
a fatal error, you could also apply a `terminate_on_error` adaptor
as well.

Then the user could apply this adapter to the scheduler before
passing it to the `task`.

For example:

```
template<std::execution::scheduler S>
struct infallible_scheduler {
  using scheduler_concept = std::execution::scheduler_t;
  S scheduler;
  auto schedule() {
    return unstoppable(terminate_on_error(std::execution::schedule(scheduler)));
  }
  bool operator==(const infallible_scheduler&) const noexcept = default;
};
template<std::execution::scheduler S>
infallible_scheduler(S) -> infallible_scheduler<S>;

std::execution::task<void, std::execution::env<>> example() {
  co_await some_cancellable_op();
}

std::execution::task<void, std::execution::env<>> caller() {
  std::execution::scheduler auto sched = co_await std::execution::read_env(get_scheduler);
  co_await std::execution::on(infallible_scheduler{sched}, example());
}
```

However, this approach has the downside that this scheduler behaviour
now also applies to all other uses of the scheduler - not just the
uses required to ensure the coroutines invariant of always resuming
on the associated context.

Other ways this could be tackled include:

- Making it the default behaviour of `affine_on` to suppress stop
    requests for the scheduling operations. That would mean that
    `affine_on` won't delegate to [`continues_on`]().
- Somehow making the behaviour a policy decision specified via the
    `Environment` template parameter of the `task`.
- Somehow using domain-based customisation to allow the coroutine
    to customise the behaviour of `affine_on`.
- Making the `task::promise_type::await_transform` apply this adapter
    to the scheduler passed to `affine_on`. i.e. it calls
    `affine_on(std::forward<Sndr>(sndr), infallible_scheduler{SCHED(*sched)})`.
    Taking this route would mean that the shape of `affine_on` should
    not be changed.

### `affine_on` Customisation For Other Senders

Assuming the the `affine_on` algorithm semantics are changed to
just require that it completes either inline or on the context of
the receiver environments `get_scheduler` query, then there are
probably some other algorithms that could either make use of
this, or provide customisations for it that short-circuit the need
to schedule unnecessarily.

For example:

- `affine_on(just(args...))` could be simplified to `just(args...)`
- `affine_on(on(sch, sndr))` can be simplified to `on(sch, sndr)`
    as on already provides `affine_on`-like semantics
- The `counting_scope::join` sender currently already provides
    `affine_on`-like semantics.
    - We could potentially simplify this sender to just complete
        inline unless the join-sender is wrapped in `affine_on`, in
        which case the resulting `affine_on(scope.join())` sender would
        have the semantics that `scope.join()` has today.
    - Alternatively, we could just customise `affine_on(scope.join())`
        to be equivalent to `scope.join()`.
- Other similar senders like those returned from
    `bounded_queue::async_push` and `bounded_queue::async_pop` which
    are defined to return a sender that will resume on the original
    scheduler.

The intended use of `affine_on` is to avoid scheduling where the
algorithm already resumes on a suitable execution agent. However,
as the proposal was late it didn't require potential optimisations.
The intend was to leave the specification of the default implementation
vague enough to let implementations avoid scheduling where they
know it isn't needed. Making these a requirement is intended for
future revisions of the standard.

It is also a bit unclear how algorithm customisation is actually
implemented in practice. Algorithms can advertise a domain via the
`get_domain` query which can then be used to transform algorithms:
`transform_sender(dom, sender, env...)`
[[exec.snd.transform]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec#snd.transform)
uses `dom.transform_sender(sender, env...)` to transform the sender
if this expression is valid (otherwise the transformation from
`default_domain` is used which doesn't transform the sender). One
way to allow special transformations for `affine_on` is to defined
the `get_domain` query for `affine_on` (well, the environment
obtained by `get_env(a)` from an `affine_on` sender `a`) to yield a
custom domain `affine_on_domain` which delegates transformations
of `affine_on(sndr, sch)` the sender `sndr` or the scheduler `sch`:

Let `affine_on_domain.transform_sender(affsndr, env...)` (where
`affsndr` is the result of `affine_on(sch, sndr)`) be

- the result of the expression `sndr.affine_on(sch, env...)` if it
    is valid, otherwise
- the result of the expression `sch.affine_on(sndr, env...)` if it
    is valid, otherwise
- not defined.

A similar approach would be used for other algorithms which can be
customised. Currently, no algorithm defines the exact ways it can
be customised in an open form and the intended design for customisations
may be different. The above outlines one possible way.

## Task Operation

This section groups three concerns relating to the way `task` gets
started and stopped:

1. `task` shouldn't reschedule upon `start()`.
2. `task`s `co_await`ing `task`s shouldn't reschedule.
3. `task` doesn't support symmetric Transfer.

### Starting A `task` Should Not Unconditionally Reschedule

In
[[task.promise]]((https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise))
p6, the wording for `initial_suspend` says that it unconditionally
suspends and reschedules onto the associated scheduler. The intent
of this wording seems to be that the coroutine ensures execution
initially starts on the associated scheduler by executing a schedule
operation and then resuming the coroutine from the initial suspend
point inside the set_value completion handler of the schedule
operation. The effect of this would be that every call to a coroutine
would have to round-trip through the scheduler, which, depending
on the behaviour of the schedule operation, might relegate it to the
back of the schedulers queue, greatly increasing latency of the
call.

The specification of `initial_suspend()` (assuming it is rephrased
to not resume the coroutine immediately) doesn't really say it
unconditionally reschedules. It merely states that an awaiter is
returned which arranges for the coroutine to get resumed on the
correct scheduler. In general, i.e., when the coroutine gets resumed
via `start(os)` on an operation state `os` obtained from `connect(tsk,
rcvr)` it will need to reschedule.  However, an implementation can
pass additional context information, e.g., via implementation
specific properties on the receiver's environment: while the
`get_scheduler` query may not provide the necessary guarantee that
the returned scheduler is the scheduler the operation was started
on a different, non-forwardable query could provide this guarantee.

A possible alternative is to require that `start(op)`, where `op`
is the result of `connect(sndr, rcvr)`, is invoked on an execution
agent associated with `get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))`, at least when
`sndr` is a `task<...>`. Such a requirement could be desirable more
general but it would also be part of the general sender/receiver
contract. The current specification in
[[exec.async.ops](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.async.ops)] doesn't
have a corresponding constraint. `task<...>` is a sender and
where it can be used with standard library algorithms this constraint
would hold.

A different way to approach the issue is to use a `task`-specific
awaitable when a `task` is `co_await`ed by another `task`. This use
of an awaiter shouldn't be observable but it may be better to
explicitly spell out that `task` has a domain with custom transformation
of the `affine_on` algorithm and `as_awaitable` operation.

### Resuming After A `task` Should Not Reschedule

Similar to the previous issue, a `task` needs to resume on the
expected scheduler. The definition of `await_transform` which is used
for a `task` is defined in [[task.promise]]((https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)) paragraph 10
(the `co_await`ed `task` would be the `sndr` parameter):

```
as_awaitable(affine_on(std::forward<Sender>(sndr), SCHED(*this)), *this)
```

As defined there is no additional information about the scheduler
on which the `sndr` completes. Thus, it is likely that a scheduling
operation is needed after a `co_await`ed `task` completes when the
outer `task` resumes, even if the `co_await`ed `task` completed on
the same execution agent.

As `task` is scheduler affine, it is likely that it completes on
the same scheduler it was started on, i.e., there shouldn't be a
need to reschedule (if the scheduler used by the `task` was changed
using `co_await change_coroutine_scheduler(sch)` it still needs to
be rescheduled). The implementation can provide a query on the state
used to execute the `task` which identifies the scheduler on which
it completed and the `affine_on` implementation can use this
information to decide whether it is necessary to reschedule after
the `task`'s completion. It would be preferable if a corresponding
query were specified by the standard library to have user-defined
senders provide similar information but currently there is no such
query.

A different approach is to transform the `affine_on(task, sch)`
operation into a `task`-specific implementation which arranges to
always complete on `sch` using `task` specific information. It may
be necessary to explicit specify or, at least, allow that `task`
provides a domain with a custom transformation for `affine_on`.

### No Support For Symmetric Transfer

The specification doesn't mention any use of symmetric transfer.
Further, the `task` gets adapted by `affine_on` in `await_transform`
([[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
paragraph 10) which produces a different sender than `task` which needs
special treatment to use symmetric transfer. With symmetric transfer
stack overflow can be avoided when operation complete immediately, e.g.

```c++
template <typename Env>
task<void, Env> test() {
    for (std::size_t i{}; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        co_await std::invoke([]()->task<void, env<>> {
            co_return;
        });
    }
}
```

When using a scheduler which actually schedules the work (rather
than immediately completing when a corresponding sender gets started)
there isn't a stack overflow but the scheduling may be slow. With
symmetric transfer the it can be possible to avoid both the expensive
scheduling operation and the stack overflow, at least in some cases.
When the inner `task` actually `co_await`s any work which synchronously
completes, e.g., `co_await just()`, the code could still result in
a stack overflow despite using symmetric transfer. There is a general
issue that stack size needs to be bounded when operations complete
synchronously. The general idea is to use a trampoline scheduler
which bounds stack size and reschedules when the stack size or the
recursion depth becomes too big.

Except for the presence or absence of stack overflows it shouldn't
be observable whether an implementation invokes the nested coroutine
directly through an awaiter interface or using the default
implementations of `as_awaitable` and `affine_on`. To address the
different scheduling problems (schedule on `start`, schedule on
completion, and symmetric transfer) it may be reasonable to mandate
that `task` customises `affine_on` and that the result of this
customisation also customises `as_awaitable`.

## Allocation

### Unusual Allocator Customisation

The allocator customisation mechanism is inconsistent with the
design of `generator` allocator customisation: with `generator`,
when you don't specify an allocator in the template arg, then you
can use any `allocator_arg` type. With `task` if no allocator is
specified in the `Environment` the allocator type defaults to
`std::allocator<std::byte>` and using an allocator with an incompatible
type results in an ill-formed program.

For example:

```c++
struct default_env {};
struct allocator_env {
    using allocator_type = std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>;
};

template <typename Env>
ex::task<int, Env> test(int i, auto&&...) {
    co_return co_await ex::just(i);
}
```

Depending on how the coroutine is invoked this may fail to compile:

- `test<default_env>(17)`: OK - use default allocator
- `test<default_env>(17, std::allocator_arg, std::allocator<int>())`: OK - allocator is convertible
- `test<default_env>(17, std::allocator_arg, std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>())`: compile-time error
- `test<alloctor_env>(17, std::allocator_arg, std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>())`: OK

The main motivator for always having an `allocator_type` is it to
support the `get_allocator` query on the receiver's environments
when `co_await`ing another sender. The immediate use of the allocator
is the allocation of the coroutine frame and these two needs can be
considered separate.

Instead of using the `allocator_type` both for the environment and
the coroutine frame, the coroutine frame could be allocated with
any allocator specified as an argument (i.e., as the argument
following an `std::allocator_arg` argument). The cost of doing so
is that the allocator stored with the coroutine frame would need
to be type-erased which is, however, fairly cheap as only the
`deallocate(ptr, size)` operation needs to be known and certainly
no extra allocation is needed to do so. If no `allocator_type` is
specified in the `Environment` argument to `task`, the
`get_allocator` query would not be available from the environment
of received used with `co_await`.

### Issue: Flexible Allocator Position

For `task<T, E>` with position of an `std::allocator_arg` can be
anywhere in the argument list. For `generator` the `std::allocator_arg`
argument needs to be the first argument. That is consistent with
other uses of `std::allocator_arg`. `task` should also require the
`std::allocator_arg` argument to be the first argument.

The reason why `task` deviates from the approach normally taken is
that the consistent with non-coroutines is questionable: the primary
reason why the `std::allocator_arg` is needed in the first position
is that allocation is delegated to `std::uses_allocator` construction.
This approach, however, doesn't apply to coroutines at all: the
coroutine frame is allocated from an `operator new()` overloaded
for the `promise_type`. In the context of coroutines the question
is rather how to make it easy to optionally support allocators.

Any coroutine which wants to support allocators for the allocation
of the coroutine frame needs to allow that allocators show up on
the parameter list. As coroutines normally have other parameters,
too, requiring that the optional `std::allocator_arg`/allocator
pair of arguments comes first effectively means that a forwarding
function is provided, e.g., for a coroutine taking an `int` parameter
for its work (`Env` is assumed to be a environment type with a
suitable definition of `allocator_type`):

```
task<void, Env> work(std::allocator_arg_t, auto, int value) {
    co_await just(value);
}
task<void, Env> work(int value) {
    return work(std::allocator_arg, std::allocator<std::byte>());
}
```

If the `allocator_arg` argument can be at an arbitrary location of
the parameter list, defining a coroutine with optional allocator
support amounts to adding a suitable trailing list of parameters,
e.g.:

```
task<void, Env> work(int value, auto&&...) {
    co_await just(value);
}
```

Constraining `task` to match the use of `generator` is entirely
possible. It seems more reasonable to rather consider relaxing the
requirement on `generator` in a future revision of the C++ standard.

### Shadowing The Environment Allocator Is Questionable

The `get_allocator` query on the environment of receiver passed to
`co_await`ed senders always returns the allocator determined when
the coroutine frame is created.  The allocator provided by the
environment of receiver the `task` is `connect`ed to is hidden.

Creating a coroutine (calling the coroutine function) chooses the
allocator for the coroutine frame, either explicitly specified or
implicitly determined. Either way the coroutine frame is allocated
when the function is called. At this point the coroutine isn't
`connect`ed to a receiver, yet.  The fundamental idea of the allocator
model is that children of an entity use the same allocator as their
parent unless an allocator is explicitly specified for a child.
The `co_await`ed entities are children of the coroutine and should
share the coroutine's allocator.

In addition, to forward the allocator from the receiver's environment
in an environment, its static type needs to be convertible to the
coroutine's allocator type: the coroutine's environment types are
determined when the coroutine is created at which point the receiver
isn't known, yet. Whether the allocator from the receiver's environment
can be used with the statically determined allocator type can't be
determined. It may be possible to use a type-erase allocator which
could be created in the operation state when the `task` is `connect`ed.

On the flip side, the receiver's environment can contain the
configuration from the user of a work-graph which is likely better
informed about the best allocator to use.  The allocator from the
receiver's environment could be forwarded if the `task`'s allocator
can be initialised with it, e.g., because the `task` use
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>`.  It isn't clear what should
happen if the receiver's environment has an allocator which can't
be converted to the allocator based `task`'s environment: at least
ignoring a mismatching allocator or producing a compile time error
are options. It is likely possible to come up with a way to configure
the desired behaviour using the environment.

## Stop Token Management

### A Stop Source Always Needs To Be Created

The specification of the `promise_type` contains exposition-only
members for a stop source and a stop token. It is expected that in
may situations the upstream stop token will be an `inplace_stop_token`
and this is also the token type exposed downstream. In these cases
the `promise_type` should store neither a stop source nor a stop
token: instead the stop token should be obtained from the upstream
stream environment. Necessarily storing a stop source and a stop
token would increase the size of the promise type by multiple
pointers.  On top of that, to forward the state of an upstream stop
token via a new stop source requires registration/deregistration
of a stop callback which requires dealing with synchronisation.

The expected implementation is, indeed, to get the stop token from
the operation state: when the operation state is created, it is
known whether the upstream stop token is compatible with the
statically determined stop token exposed by `task` to `co_await`ed
operations via the respective receiver's environment. It the type
is compatible there is no need to store anything beyond the receiver
from which a stop token can be obtained using the `get_stop_token`
query when needed. Otherwise, the operation state can store an
optional stop source which gets initialised and connected to the
upstream stop toke via a stop callback when the first stop token
is requested.

The exposition-only members are not meant to imply that a corresponding
object is actually stored or where they are. Instead, they are
merely meant to talk about the corresponding entities where the
behaviour of the environment is described. If the current wording
is considered to imply that these entities actually exist or it can
be misunderstood to imply that, the wording may need some massaging
possibly using specification macros to refer to the respective
entities in the operation state.

### The Wording Implies The Stop Token Is Default Constructible

Using an exposition-only member for the stop token implies that the
stop token type is default constructible. The stop token types are
generally not default constructible and are, instead, created via
the stop source and always refer to the corresponding stop source.

The intent here is, indeed, that the stop token type isn't actually
stored at all: the operation state either stores a stop source which
is used to get the stop token or, probably in the comment case, the
stop token is obtained from the upstream receiver's environment by
querying `get_stop_token`. The rewording for the previous concern
should also address this concern.

## Miscellaneous Concerns

The remaining concerns aren't as coupled to other concerns and
discussed separately.

### Task Is Not Actually Lazily Started

The wording for `task<...>::promise_type::initial_suspend` in
[[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
p6 may imply that a `task` is eagerly started:

> `auto initial_suspend() noexcept;`
>
> _Returns:_ An awaitable object of unspecified type ([expr.await])
> whose member functions arrange for
>
> - the calling coroutine to be suspended,
> - the coroutine to be resumed on an execution agent of the execution
>     resource associated with `SCHED(*this)`.

In particular the second bullet can be interpreted to mean that the
task gets resumed immediately. That wouldn't actually work because
`SCHED(*this)` only gets initialised when the `task` gets `connect`ed
to a suitable receiver. The intention of the current specification
is to establish the invariant that the coroutine is running on the
correct scheduler when the coroutine is resumed (see discussion of
`affine_on` below). The mechanisms used to achieve that are not
detailed to avoid requiring that it gets scheduled. The formulation
should, at least, be improved to clarify that the coroutine isn't
resumed immediately, possibly changing the text like this:

> - the coroutine [to be resumed]{.rm}[resuming]{.add} on an execution
>     agent of the execution resource associated with `SCHED(*this)`
>     [when it gets resumed]{.add}.

The proposed fix from the issue is to specify that `initial_suspend()`
always returns `suspend_always{}` and require that `start(...)`
calls `handle.resume()` to resume the coroutine on the appropriate
scheduler after `SCHED(*this)` has been initialised. The corresponding
change could be

Change [[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise) paragraph 6:

> `auto initial_suspend() noexcept;`
>
::: rm
> _Returns:_ An awaitable object of unspecified type ([expr.await])
> whose member functions arrange for:
>
> - the calling coroutine to be suspended,
> - the coroutine to be resumed on an execution agent of the execution
>     resource associated with `SCHED(*this)`.
:::
::: add
> _Returns:_ `suspend_always{}`.
:::

The suggestion is to ensure that the task gets resumed on the
correct associated context via added requirements on the receiver's
`get_scheduler()` (see below).

In separate discussions it was suggested to relax the specification
of `initial_suspend()` to allow returning an awaiter which does
semantically what `suspend_always` does but isn't necessary
`suspend_always`. The proposal was to copy the wording of the
`suspend_always` specification
[[coroutine.trivial.awaitables]](https://eel.is/c++draft/coroutine.trivial.awaitables#lib:suspend_always).
This specification just shows the class completion definition.

### The Coroutine Frame Is Destroyed Too Late

When the `task` completes from a suspended coroutine without ever
reaching `final_suspend` the coroutine frame lingers until the
operation state object is destroyed. This happens when the `task`
isn't resumed because a `co_await`ed sender completed with
`set_stopped()` or when the `task` completes using `co_yield when_error(e)`.
In these cases the order of destruction of object may be unexpected:
objects held by the coroutine frame may be destroyed only long after
the respective completion function was called.

This behaviour is an oversight in the specification and not intentional
at all. Instead, there should probably be a statement that the
coroutine frame is destroyed before the any of the completion
functions is invoked. The implication is that the results can't be
stored in the coroutine frame but that is fine as the best place
store them is in the operation state.

### `task<T, E>` Has No Default Arguments

The current specification of `task<T, E>` doesn't have any default arguments
in its first declaration in [[execution.syn]](https://eel.is/c++draft/execution.syn). The intent was to default the
type `T` to `void` and the environment `E` to `env<>`. That is, this change
should be applied to [[execution.syn]](https://eel.is/c++draft/execution.syn):

> ```
>   ...
>   // [exec.task]
>   template <class T@[ = void]{.add}@, class Environment@[ = env<>]{.add}@>
>   class task;
>   ...
> ```

It isn't catastrophic if that change isn't made but it seems to
improve usability without any drawbacks.

### `unhandled_stopped()` Isn't `noexcept`

The `unhandled_stopped()` member function of `task::promise_type`
[[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
is not currently marked as `noexcept`.

As this method is generally called from the `set_stopped`
completion-handler of a receiver (such as in [[exec.as.awaitable] p4.3](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.as.awaitable#4.3))
and is invoked without handler from a `noexcept` function, we should
probably require that this function is marked `noexcept` as well.

The equivalent method defined as part of the `with_awaitable_senders`
base-class
([[exec.with.awaitable.senders]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.with.awaitable.senders#1)
p1) is also marked `noexcept`.

This change should be applied to [[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise):

> ```
>     ...
>     void uncaught_exception();
>     coroutine_handle<> unhandled_stopped()@[ noexcept]{.add}@;
>
>     void return_void(); // present only if is_void_v<T> is true;
>     ...
> ```
>
> ...
>
> ```
> coroutine_handle<> unhandled_stopped()@[ noexcept]{.add}@;
> ```
>
> [13]{.pnum} _Effects_: Completes the asynchronous operation associated with `STATE(*this)` by invoking `set_stopped(std::move(RCVR(*this)))`.

### The Environment Design May Be Inefficient

The environment returned from `get_env(rcvr)` for the receiver used
to `connect` to `co_await`ed sender is described in terms of members
of the `promise_type::@_state_@` in
[[task.promise](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)]
paragraph 15. In particular the `@_state_@` contains a member
`@_own-env_@` which gets initialised via the upstream receiver's
environment (if the corresponding expression is valid). As the
environment `@_own-env_@` is initialised with a temporary, `@_own-env_@`
will need to create a copy of whatever it is holding.

As the environment exposed to `co_await`ed senders via the
`get_env(rcvr)` is statically determined when the `task` is created,
not when the `task` is `connect`ed to an upstream receiver, the
environment needs to be type erase. Some of the queries (`get_scheduler`,
`get_stop_token`, and `get_allocator`) are known and already receive
treatment by the `task` itself. However, the `task` cannot know about
user-defined properties which may need to be type-erased as well. To
all the `Environment` to possibly type-erase properties from the
upstream receiver, an `own-env-t` object is created and a reference to
the object is passed to the `Environment` constructor (if there are
suitable constructors). Thus, the entire use of `own-env-t` is about
enabling storage of whatever is needed to type-erase the result of
user-defined queries. Ideally, this functionality isn't needed and
the `Environment` parameter doesn't specify an `env_type`. If it is
needed the type-erase will likely need to store some data.

### No Completion Scheduler

The concern raised is that `task` doesn't define a `get_env` that
returns an environment with a `get_completion_scheduler<Tag>` query.
As a result, it will be necessary to reschedule in situations although
the `task` already completes on the correct scheduler.

The query `get_completion_scheduler(env)` operates on the sender's
environment, i.e., it would operate on the `task`'s environment.
However, when the `task` is created it has no information about the
scheduler, yet, it is going to use. The entire information the
`task` has is what is passed to the coroutine [factory] function.
The information about any scheduling gets provided when the `task`
is `connect`ed to a receiver: the receiver provides the queries on
where the task is started (`get_scheduler`). The `task` may complete
on this scheduler assuming the scheduler isn't changed (using
`co_await change_coroutine_scheduler(sch)`).

The only place where a `task` actually knows its completion scheduler
is once it has completed. However, there is no query or environment
defined for completed operation states. Thus, it seems there is no
way where a `get_completion_scheduler` would be useful. A future
evolution of the sender/receiver interface may change that in which
case `task` should be revisited.

### Awaitable non-`sender`s Are Not Supported

The overload of `await_transform` described in
[[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
is constrained to require arguments to satisfy the
[`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts) concept.
However, this precludes awaiting types that implement the
[`as_awaitable()`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.as.awaitable)
customisation point but that do not satisfy the
[`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts) concept from
being able to be awaited within a `task` coroutine.

This is inconsistent with the behaviour of the [`with_awaitable_senders`]()
base class defined in
[[exec.with.awaitable.senders]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.with.awaitable.senders),
which only requires that the awaited value supports the
[`as_awaitable()`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.as.awaitable)
operation.

The rationale for this is that the argument needs to be passed to
the
[`affine_on`](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#executionaffine_on-exec.affine.on)
algorithm which currently requires its argument to model
[`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts). This requirement in turn is
there because it is unclear how to guarantee scheduler affinity with an awaitable-only
interface without wrapping a coroutine around the awaitable.

Do we want to consider relaxing this constraint to be consistent with the constraints
on
[[exec.with.awaitable.senders]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.with.awaitable.senders)?

This would require either:

- relaxing the [`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts)
  constraint on the `affine_on` algorithm to also allow an argument
  that has only an
  [`as_awaitable()`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.as.awaitable) but
  that did not satisfy the
  [`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts) concept.
- extending the [`sender`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.snd.concepts)
  concept to match types that provide the `.as_awaitable()`
  member-function similar to how it supports types with `operator
  co_await()` (see [[exec.connect]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.connect)).

### Should `task::promise_type` Use `with_awaitable_senders`?

The existing [[exec]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec) wording added
the
[`with_awaitable_senders`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec#with.awaitable.senders)
helper class with the intention that it be usable as the base-class
for asynchronous coroutine promise-types to provide the ability to
await senders. It does this by providing the necessary `await_transform`
overload and also the `unhandled_stopped` member-function necessary
to support the `as_awaitable()` adaptor for senders.

However, the current specification of `task::promise_types` does not
use this facility for a couple of reasons:

- It needs to apply the `affine_on` adaptor to awaited senders.
- It needs to provide a custom implementation of `unhandled_stopped`
    that reschedules onto the original scheduler in the case that it
    is different from the current scheduler (e.g. due to
    `co_await change_coroutine_scheduler{other}`).

This raises a couple of questions:

- Should there also be a `with_affine_awaitable_senders` that
    implements the scheduler affinity logic?
- Is `with_awaitable_senders` actually the right design if the first
    coroutine type we add to the standard library doesn't end up using it?

These are valid questions. It seems the `with_awaitable_senders` class
was designed at time when there was no consensus that a `task` coroutine
should be scheduler affine by default. However, these questions don't
really affect the design of `task` and they can be answered in a future
revision of the standard. The `task` specification also uses a few other
tools which could be useful for users who want to implement their own
custom `task`-like coroutine. Such tools should probably be proposed for
inclusion into a future revision of the C++ standard, too.

However, what is relevant to the `task` specification is that the
wording for `unhandled_stopped` in
[[task.promise]](https://wiki.edg.com/pub/Wg21sofia2025/StrawPolls/P3552R3.html#class-taskpromise_type-task.promise)
paragraph 13 doesn't spell out that the `set_stopped` completion
is invoked on the correct scheduler.

### A Future Coroutine Feature Could Avoid `co_yield` For Errors

The mechanism to complete with an error without using an exception
uses `co_yield with_error(x)`. This use may surprise users as
`co_yield`ing is normally assumed not to be a final operation. A
future language change may provide a better way to achieve the
objective of reporting errors without using exceptions.

Using not, yet, proposed features which may become part of a future
revision of the C++ standard may always provide facilities which
result in a better design for pretty much anything. There is no
current `task` implementation and certainly none which promises ABI
stability. Assuming a corresponding language change gets proposed
reasonably early for the next cycle, implementation can take it into
account for possibly improving the interface without the need to
break ABI. The shape of the envisioned language change is unknown
but most likely it is an extension which hopefully be integrated
with the existing design. The functionality to use `co_yield`
would, however, continue to exist until it eventually gets
deprecated and removed (assuming a better alternative emerges).

### There Is No Hook To Capture/Restore TLS

This concern is the only one I was aware of for a few weeks prior
to the Sofia meeting. I believe the necessary functionality can be
implemented although it is possibly harder to do than with more
direct support. The concern raised is that existing code accesses
thread local storage (TLS) to store context information. When a
`co_await` actually suspends it is possible that a different task
running on the same thread replaces used TLS data or the task gets
resumed on a different thread of a thread pool. In that case it is
necessary to capture the TLS variables prior to suspending and
restoring them prior to resuming the coroutine.  There is currently
no way to actually do that.

The sender/receiver approach to propagating context information
isn't using TLS but rather the environments accessed via the receiver.
However, existing software does use TLS and at least for migration
corresponding support may be necessary. One way to implement this
functionality is using a scheduler adapter with a customised
`affine_on` algorithm:

- When the `affine_on` algorithm is started, it captures the relevant
    TLS data into the operation state and then starts `affine_on`
    for the adapted scheduler with a receiver observing the
    completions.
- When the adapted scheduler invokes any of the completion signals
    the TLS data is restored before invoke the algorithms completion
    signal.

Support for optionally capturing some state before starting a child
operation and restoring the captured started before resuming could
be added to the `task`, avoiding the need to use custom scheduling.
Doing so would yield a nicer and easier to use interface. In
environment where TLS is currently used and developers move to an
asynchronous model, failure to capture and restore data in TLS is a
likely source of errors. However, it will be necessary to specify
what data needs to be stored, i.e., the problems can't be automatically
avoided.

### Consider Supporting co_return { args... };

The current specification of `return_value` in the `promise_type`
specifies the function without a default type for the template
parameter:

```
template <class V>
void return_value(V&& value); // present only if is_void<T> is false
```

As a result it isn't possible to use aggregate initialization without
mentioning the type. For example, the following code isn't valid:

```
struct aggregate { int value{0} };
[]() -> task<aggregate, std::env<>> { co_return {}; };
[]() -> task<aggregate, std::env<>> { co_return { 42 }; };
```

To better match the normal functions, the template
parameter should be defaulted which would make the code above valid:

```
template <class V @[` = T`]{.add}@>
void return_value(V&& value); // present only if is_void<T> is false
```

There isn't anything broken with the specification but adding the
default type improves usability. If necessary, this change can be
applied in a future revision of the standard. It would be nice to
fix it for C++26.


# Conclusion

There are some parts of the specification which can be misunderstood.
These should be clarified correspondingly. In most of these cases
the change only affects the wording and doesn't affect the design.

For the issues around `affine_on` there are some potential design
changes. In particular with respect to the exact semantics of
`affine_on` the design was possibly unclear. Likewise, explicitly
specifying that `task` customises `affine_on` and provides an
`as_awaitable` function is somewhat in design space. The intention
was that doing so would be possible with the current specification
and it just didn't spell out how `co_await` a `task` from a `task`
actually works.

In any case, some fixed of the specification are needed.

# Potential Polls

1. Should `task` be renamed to something else?
2. Is the naming scheme `task@_year_@` an approach to be used?
