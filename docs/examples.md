demo scheduler affinity
</summary>

The example program
[`c++now-affinity.cpp`](https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-affinity.cpp)
uses [`demo::thread_loop`](../examples/demo-thread_loop.hpp) to demonstrate
the behavior of _scheduler affinity_: the idea is that scheduler
affinity causes the coroutine to resume on the same scheduler as
the one the coroutine was started on. The program implements three
coroutines which have most of their behavior in common:

1. Each coroutine is executed from `main` using <code>sync_wait(_fun_(loop.get_scheduler()))</code>.
2. Each coroutine prints the id of the thread it is executing on prior to any `co_await` and after all `co_await` expression.
3. Each coroutine `co_await`s the result of `scheduler(sched) | then([]{ ... })` where the function passed to `then` just prints the thread id.
4. `work2` additionally changes the coroutines scheduler to be an `inline_scheduler` and later restores the original scehduler using `change_coroutine_scheduler`.
5. While `work1` and `work2` use the default scheduler (`task_scheduler` a
type-erased scheduler which gets initialized from the receiver's environment's `get_scheduler`), `work3` sets the coroutine's scheduler up to be `inline_scheduler`, effectively causing the coroutine to resume wherever
the `co_await`'s expression resumed.

The output of the program is someting like the below:

```
before id=0x1fd635f00
then id  =0x16b64b000
after id =0x1fd635f00

before id=0x1fd635f00
then id  =0x16b64b000
after1 id=0x16b64b000
then id  =0x16b64b000
after2 id=0x1fd635f00

before id=0x1fd635f00
then id  =0x16b64b000
after id =0x16b64b000
```

It shows that:

1. The thread on which the `then`'s function is executed is always the
same and different from the thread each of the coroutines started on.
2. For `work1` the `co_await` resumes on the same thread as the one the
coroutine was started on.
3. For `work2` the first `co_await` after `schedule(sched)` resumes on
the thread used by `sched`. After restoring the original scheduler the
`co_await` resumes on the original thread.
4. For `work3` the `co_await` resumes on the thread used by `sched` as
the `inline_scheduler` doesn't do any actual scheduling.

demo allocator use
</summary>

This demo shows how to configure `task`'s environment argument to
use a different allocator than the default `std::allocator<std::byte>`.
To do so it defines an environment type `with_allocator` which
defines a nested type alias `allocator_type` to be
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>`.

The coroutine `coro` shows how to use `read_env` to extract the
used allocator object to potentially use it for any allocation
purposes within the coroutine.  There are two uses of `coro`, the
first one using the default which just uses
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>()` to allocate memory.
The second use explicitly specifies the memory resource
`std::pmr::new_delete_resource()` to initialized the use
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>`.

demo basic <code>task</code> use
</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-basic.cpp'><code>c++now-basic.cpp</code></a>
shows some basic use of a `task`:

1. The coroutine `basic` just `co_await`s the awaiter `std::suspend_never{}` which immediately completes.
    This use demonstrates that any awaiter can be `co_await`ed by a `task<...>`.
2. The coroutine `await_sender` demonstrates the results of `co_await`ing various senders. It uses variations of
    `just*` to show the different results:
    - `co_await`ing a sender completing with `set_value_t()`, e.g., `just()`, produces an expression with type `void`.
    - `co_await`ing a sender completing with `set_value_t(T)`, e.g., `just(1)`, produces an expression with type `T`.
    - `co_await`ing a sender completing with <code>set_value_t(T<sub>0</sub>, ..., T<sub>n</sub>)</code>, e.g., `just(1, true)`, produces an expression with type <code>tuple&lt;T<sub>0</sub>, ..., T<sub>n</sub>&gt;</code>.
    - `co_await`ing a sender completing with `set_error_t(E)`, e.g., `just_error(1)`, results in an exception of type `E` being thrown.
    - `co_await`ing a sender completing with `set_stopped_t()`, e.g., `just_stopped()`, results in the corouting never getting resumed although all local objects are properly destroyed.

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-cancel.cpp'><code>c++now-cancel.cpp</code></a>
shows a coroutine `co_await`ing `just_stopped()` which results in the coroutine getting cancelled. The coroutine will
complete with `set_stopped()`.

demo how to handle errors within <code>task</code>
</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-errors.cpp'><code>c++now-errors.cpp</code></a>
shows examples of how to handle errors within a coroutine:

- The coroutine `error_result` simply `co_await`s a sender producing an error (`just_error(17)`). When
    a `co_await`ed sender completes with `set_error_t(T)` an exception of type `T` is thrown and the error
    needs to be handled with a `try`/`catch` block. Otherwise the coroutine itself completes with `set_error_t(exception_ptr)`
    where the `exception_ptr` hold the thrown exception object.
- The coroutine `expected` uses a sender algorithm `as_expected` which is implemented at the top of the example
    to turn the result of the `co_await`ed sender into an object of type `expected<T, E>`, avoiding an exception
    from being thrown.

demo passing a custom envrionment into a <code>task</code>
</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-query.cpp'><code>c++now-query.cpp</code></a>
shows how to define and use a custom environment element.

1. The coroutine `with_env` uses a simple environment named `context` which just defines a custom query for `get_value`
    to obtain a value. The value itself gets initialized from the environment of the receiver used with the `task`.
2. The coroutine `with_fancy_env` uses an environment which embed a an object depending the type of the environment
    of the receiver used with the `task`. While the type accessed from within the `task` needs to be type-erased,
    the actually stored value can depend on the environment of the upstream receiver.

The example

shows the result types of successful senders using variatons of `just`:

- `co_await just()` doesn't produce a value, i.e., the type of the expression is `void`.
- `co_await just(1)` produces an `int`.
- `co_await just(1, true)` produces a `tuple<int, bool>`.

</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-return.cpp'><code>c++now-return.cpp</code></a>
shows various ways of returning normally (without an error) for a `task`. Some of the coroutines are set up to produce
specific error results although none of them are actually use:

- `default_return` shows that the default return type for `task<>` is `void`.
- `void_return` explicitly specifies a `void` return type.
- `int_return` specifies the return type as `int` and returns an `int` value.
- `error_return` specifies the return type as `int` and also specifies custom error results.
- `no_error_return` specifies the return type as `int` and also specifies that the coroutine can't produce any error.

demo how to get and use a stop token in a `task`
</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-stop_token.cpp'><code>c++now-stop_token.cpp</code></a>
shows how to get a stop token in side a `task` and how to use it to cancel active work. It doesn't actually complete
with a `set_stopped()` but completes with `set_value()`.

- In the coroutine `co_await read_env(get_stop_token)` is used to get a stop token.
- In the loop the value of `token.stop_requested()` is checked to determine if the loop should continue.
- In `main` an `inplace_stop_source` is used to have something which can be stopped.
- When running the coroutine `stopping` on a separate thread, the environment is changed using `write_env` to use stop token from `main`'s stop source in the environment.
- After sleeping for a bit, `source.request_stop()` is called to trigger cancellation of the coroutine.

demo exiting a <code>task</code> with an error
</summary>

The example
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/main/examples/c%2B%2Bnow-with_error.cpp'><code>c++now-with_error.cpp</code></a>
shows how a coroutine can be exited reporting an error without throwing an exception. To do so, the coroutine
uses `co_yield with_error(e)`. By default the `task` only declares `set_error_t(exception_ptr)`. To return
other errors, an environment declarating a suitable `set_error_t(E)` completion using the `error_types` alias is used.

## Tools Used By The Examples

<details>
<summary>
<a href='https://github.com/bemanproject/task/blob/remove-net-and-improve-docs/examples/demo-thread_loop.hpp'><code>demo::thread_loop</code> is a <code>run_loop</code> whose <code>run()</code> is called from a <code>std::thread</code>.
</summary>

Technically [`demo::thread_loop`](../examples/demo-thread_loop.hpp)
is a class `public`ly derived from `execution::run_loop` which is
also owning a `std::thread`. The `std::thread` is constructed with
a function object calling `run()` on the
[`demo::thread_loop`](../examples/demo-thread_loop.hpp) object.
Destroying the object calls `finish()` and then `join()`s the
`std::thread`: the destructor will block until the `execution::run_loop`'s
`run()` returns.

The important bit is that work executed on the
[`demo::thread_loop`](../examples/demo-thread_loop.hpp)'s `scheduler`
will be executed on a corresponding `std::thread`.
